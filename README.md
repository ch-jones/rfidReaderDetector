# rfidReaderDetector
Arduino Code for RFID Reader Detector Project
This code uses the public domain ReadAnalogVoltage library.

Additional code by Caleb Jones, Tryston Hoyes and Blayne Robinson.
The RFID Reader Detector electronics project and code created for DESN37900 at Sheridan College Â© 2018

The analog input, which reads the electromagnetic waves of RFID readers and converts to voltage, triggers some type of feedback. This feedback can be changed in the electronics and in the code to reflect the hardware used.
